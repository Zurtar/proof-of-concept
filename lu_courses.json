      "Description": "A study of texts written between roughly 1830 and 1900. Though the adjective \"Victorian\" carries with it connotations of prudishness and propriety, our analysis will show that this period was in fact a time of radical social change, including: clashes between science and religion; the development of the \"angel in the house\" and the \"New Woman\"; increased urbanization, with both its cosmopolitan pleasures and its slums; and the explosion of popular print. Readings will focus on everything from orphans to vampires in order to understand how writers of fiction, drama, poetry, and new genres (such as reportage and the case study) sought to capture and to resolve Victorian England's many social conflicts.\r\n\r\nStudents who have previous credit in English 3417 or 3418 may not take English 3430 for credit.

Magnetostatics covers calculations of the magnetic field and the Lorentz force using the Biot-Savart law and Ampere's circuital law. Finally, electrodynamics covers Faraday's law of induction with applications in mutual and self-inductance. This course requires a strong background in mathematics and some vector calculus.",
